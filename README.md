# 16-bit-multiplier
This project implements a 16-bit multiplier using Verilog hardware description language. The multiplier uses the shift-and-add algorithm, which is a fundamental technique for binary multiplication. The project includes a Verilog module for the multiplier and a corresponding testbench to verify its functionality.
